Summary of Incomplete Work
- Frontend pages still rely on mock content for products, cart state, testimonials, and locale copy; wire these to live APIs or CMS data.
- Authentication, authorization, and user session handling are unstubbed across Login, Signup, Navbar, and protected routes.
- Checkout flow is placeholder only; Stripe payment intents/sessions, backend endpoints, and webhook handling remain to be implemented.
- Product detail experience (`/product/:id`) and supplemental marketing routes referenced in navigation are missing.
- Shared state management (cart totals, auth status, search) is not centralized, leaving Navbar, Cart, and Checkout disconnected.
- Automated testing and accessibility reviews have not been started, leaving core journeys unvalidated.

Setup Steps After Cloning
1. git clone <your-fork-url>
2. cd ecommerce-app-fullstack-stripe
3. Copy the sample environment file: `cp .env.example Backend/.env` and `cp .env.example frontend/.env`
4. Install dependencies in both apps:
   - `cd frontend && npm install`
   - `cd ../Backend && npm install`
5. Start local development servers:
   - Frontend: `npm run dev` inside `frontend`
   - Backend: `npm run dev` inside `Backend`
6. Update environment variables with real MongoDB and Stripe credentials before connecting to production services.
7. (Optional) Build and run containers with `docker compose up --build` once the backend service is added to the compose file.

Detailed Work Items

General setup
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in both Backend and frontend if environment variables are needed; current pages run without secrets.
- Install dependencies with `npm install` inside `frontend` and run `npm run dev` to boot the Vite dev server.
- Lint anytime with `npm run lint`; there are no automated tests yet.

Incomplete or mocked flows by page
- `frontend/src/pages/Home.tsx`: Landing content is static. Replace hard-coded arrays (featuredProducts, trendingCollections, testimonials, perks) with CMS or API data when available.
- `frontend/src/pages/Shop.tsx`: Product grid uses static data and in-memory filters. Hook up to catalog API, add loading/error UI, and wire "View details" to a real PDP route. Persist chosen filters (query params or local storage) if desired.
- `frontend/src/pages/Cart.tsx`: Cart items are static. Connect to shared cart state/API, implement quantity edits, move-to-saved, and remove actions. Replace shipping/tax estimates with calculated values.
- `frontend/src/pages/Checkout.tsx`: Placeholder component. Build the actual checkout form (shipping, billing, payment) and integrate with Stripe/Backend once available.
- `frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx`: Form is client-side only. Swap timeout mock for real auth call, surface server errors, and redirect using authenticated user state.
- `frontend/src/pages/Signup.tsx`: Validation runs locally. Send form data to auth service, handle error states, and transition to post-signup experience (auto-login or login redirect).
- Missing product detail route: `/product/:id` links are placeholders. Create the page before launching the Shop grid.
- Consider adding `/auth/forgot-password` and other auth flows referenced by links.

Shared components
- `frontend/src/components/Navbar.tsx`: `navLinks` and search callback expect real data. Provide `onSearchSubmit`, cart count, and auth state from global store. Replace placeholder routes (Shop, Collections, Deals, Contact) when implemented.
- `frontend/src/components/Footer.tsx`: Newsletter submit handler is optional but currently no-ops. Connect to email marketing service when ready; update socials and column links if URLs change.
- `frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx`: Acts as shell only. If some pages require footer-less layout or different backgrounds, extend props or add route-level configuration.

State management & integration
- Introduce a shared state solution (React Context, Zustand, Redux, etc.) or hooks to distribute cart/auth data to Navbar, Cart, Checkout, and future pages.
- Coordinate with Backend service contracts (Stripe checkout session, product catalog, auth) before wiring live data.

Testing & QA
- Add component tests for forms (Login/Signup) and flows (Cart actions, Shop filters).
- Introduce end-to-end coverage (Playwright/Cypress) for primary journeys once APIs are stable.

Release readiness checklist
- Real data wired for navigation targets (`/shop`, `/cart`, `/checkout`, `/auth/*`, product detail).
- Form submissions integrate with backend/auth services.
- Visual/UX review across breakpoints for Shop and Cart grids.
- Accessibility review: focus states, ARIA roles, and keyboard support on filters and forms.
